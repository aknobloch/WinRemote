Name TBD – Windows Keyboard extension Application
Requirements

Purpose:
	The purpose of this application is to provide alternative options to execute common commands and macros in a way convenient for those who may experience difficulty when using shortcuts and similar commands in a Windows operating system. Users will be able to easily execute simple or complex commands at the push of a button by using an easy to read interface providing multiple commands and macros to choose from. Applications running on the currently connected Windows platform can be targeted by the user, while a mobile side application displays the commands and macros that can be executed.


Scope:
	This application will provide all the basic commands and shortcuts that contribute to ease of use in the Windows OS. Users will be given the option to create profiles for specific applications which can be customized to display associated commands. Due to time constraints, the initial release of this product will only include the most basic Windows commands such a cut, copy, or paste, along with a few others. A secure connection between the Windows and Android side application will be vital to keep users safe and secure when executing commands. This product will not allow for complete control over Windows applications, but rather provide an alternative method to execute common Windows commands on targeted applications and areas in the Windows OS. Users will not be able to enter customized commands initially, but will instead create macros that allow them to choose multiple stock commands to be executed in a specified order.
