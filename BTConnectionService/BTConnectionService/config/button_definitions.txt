# Pound sign is intepreted as a comment.
# Button definitions are in the form <Template>;<Name>;<Action>
# Template is an optional field.
#
# Action is single keystroke, defined in the format <Modifier>+<Keys>
# The modifier is optional. The keys are specified via InputSimulator.VirtualKeyCode
# or the values 0-9 and A-Z. For the config file, do not include the VK_ prefix
# Full list of keycodes here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd375731(VS.85).aspx
#
# For example, to specify the shorcut named "Select All" with the control key as the
# modifier and the 'a' key as the pressed key, the definition would look like the following:
# Select All;CONTROL+A
#
# Multiple modifiers or keys in each definition can be joined via a comma-separated list.
# For example, to specify "Save All," with control and shift as modifiers and 's' as the
# key pressed, the definition would look like the following:
# Save All;CONTROL,LSHIFT+S
