# About WinRemote

WinRemote is a project aimed at enabling remote execution of Window's shorcuts from a mobile device. This was inspired by the concern that people with physical disabilities might not be able to easily execute keyboard shortcuts, or commands in general, and the existing solutions for this are often expensive and limited. In addition to the physically disabled, this application can be used by anyone who wants quick, remote access to keyboard shortcuts. Whether pausing a movie via the `space` bar, performing a repetitive command in a video game or simply changing the volume of your PC remotely, WinRemote is here to help.

# Getting Started

### Up and Running

There is nothing to install at this time, simply run the server executable and the app. The downloads (and more information) for our installation package can be found in the [releases section](https://github.com/soft-eng-practicum/disabledTech/releases).

### Creating Custom Shortcuts

While we hope to one day support a graphical and robust way of defining shortcuts, the current implementation of WinRemote relies on some manual editing of a configuration file. This file, and instructions for editing, can be found in the `BTConnectionService/config/button_definitions.txt` file. **After modifications are made, you will need to reset the Android application by either disconnecting and reconnecting, or simple closing and re-opening the app.**
