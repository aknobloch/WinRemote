# Intro

Hello and welcome!  

It's currently 2017 and there are so many amazing keyboard shortcuts to make our lives easier.  Some of these shortcuts can require a few keys to be pressed simultaneously or even a long key press such as clicking and dragging the mouse.  We are aware and troubled that these events can be difficult for some users.  DisabledTech is here to harness the power of technology and give all users equal power behind a keyboard.  We will start off by creating a mobile app, android first, that will allow users to pick from a pre-built library of commands or create and send their own custom commands from a phone app to a windows system.  These big beautiful buttons that our app provides will be an elegant and simple alternative to those pesky complex keyboard shortcuts.  All this and an easy to use user interface this app is intended for use and will benefit all users.

## What can it do (we could put features or changes here?)

* version 0.0.0 - Nothing yet unfortunately, we haven’t started... :(
